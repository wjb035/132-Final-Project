Project Summary:
Weight Sensors will be attached to a platform as well as an arduino. The user will place their basket of laundry on the platform- which will use the weight sensors attached to the arduino to take in the weight.The arduino will communicate with the raspberry pi and send the data of the weight. The GUI will have a database of detergents- which the user will input their detergent type on. The Pi will calculate how much detergent is optimal for the weight of the laundry. Then, there will be a separate weight sensor which is for measuring detergent- the GUI will display to the user when the cup is at the correct weight.
 
Features:
Core-Weighing clothes, displaying how much detergent is used, database of detergents from the user to select from, calculating the amount of detergent needed, a settings menu for the user to change different settings (such as the calibrated weight of the basket, clearing old settings, etc.)
Extra- Automatically dispenses the proper amount of detergent into the cup so the user doesnâ€™t have to, light or sound when the user has dispensed the proper amount of detergent, motion sensor to aid in automatically dispensing, way for the pi to connect to the internet as a way for the user to input their own detergent if none is shown (more ambitious)

GPIO:
The GPIO will communicate with the arduino to collect weight from both the laundry basket and, if possible, the cup that will hold detergent. Calibrating the laundry basket will also be a feature of this project.
 
GUI:
The GUI will have a search list that will have the popular brands and types of detergent. There will be a list of previous searches and a settings menu. The settings menu is where we will calibrate the laundry basket weight and clear history. The menu will also allow the user to switch themes (e.i. Change the background color)
